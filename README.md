# tabber
Fine grained browser session information


This is an extension for Firefox based browsers that gives fine grained information about the browsing session, and logs to the browser console. Information include what a tab a URL was loaded to, at what time, and if this URL has been previously loaded in that session. It also logs when a tab becomes active or inactive and when tabs are closed.

Note: this extension is in the very early stages of development.
